The sun rises in the east.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
All that glitters is not gold.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
The early bird catches the worm.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Actions speak louder than words.
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
A watched pot never boils.
You can’t judge a book by its cover.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
Don’t count your chickens before they hatch.
Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.
Good things come to those who wait.
Practice makes perfect.
Time flies when you’re having fun.
Laughter is the best medicine.
You can’t have your cake and eat it too.
The more, the merrier.
It’s better to be safe than sorry.
Curiosity killed the cat.
The best things in life are free.
A friend in need is a friend indeed.
If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.
Two heads are better than one.
A fool and his money are soon parted.
You can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
A leopard can’t change its spots.
Better late than never.
The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
Out of sight, out of mind.
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
There’s no such thing as a free lunch.
Blood is thicker than water.
If you want something done right, do it yourself.
The customer is always right.
The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.
If you can’t beat them, join them.
You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink.
Time is money.
Better safe than sorry.
The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.
What goes around comes around.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
A penny saved is a penny earned.
